# Contact Manager Application
This is a simple Contact Manager built using React, with JSON Server providing a simulated backend API. The application allows users to add, view, edit, and manage contacts in an intuitive interface. It's an excellent project for beginners to learn React, perform basic CRUD operations, and interact with a RESTful API.

### Features
- Add Contacts: Users can create new contacts by providing a name and email address.
- View Contacts: All contacts are displayed in a list format for easy access.
- Edit Contacts: Users can update existing contact information using an edit form.

### JSON Server Integration
This project leverages JSON Server to simulate backend operations, enabling API-like interactions without needing a full backend setup.

### Technologies Used
- React: For building the dynamic user interface.
- Axios: For making HTTP requests to the simulated backend.
- JSON Server: For simulating a REST API and persisting contact data.
- Bootstrap: For responsive and user-friendly styling.
