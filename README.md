This is a simple Contact Manager application built with React, powered by JSON Server for backend API simulation. The project allows users to add, view, edit, and manage contacts in a user-friendly interface. It's a great starting point for learning React, basic CRUD operations, and how to interact with a RESTful API.

Features:
  Add Contacts: Users can add new contacts with a name and email address.
  View Contacts: All added contacts are displayed in a list format.
  Edit Contacts: Users can update the details of existing contacts through an edit form.
  
JSON Server Integration: The project uses JSON Server to simulate a backend, allowing for API-like interaction without a full backend setup.

Technologies Used:
  React: For building the user interface.
  Axios: For making HTTP requests to the JSON Server.
  JSON Server: For simulating a REST API and persisting data.
  Bootstrap:For styling
